## 💡 How to Unleash the Dorking Power:

1.  **Select Your Search Engine:** Choose from Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, or Yandex.
2.  **Enter Keywords:** Type your main search terms. Use **single quotes** for exact phrases (e.g., `'highly confidential'`).
3.  **Toggle Operators:** Click the checkboxes next to the operators you want to use (e.g., `site:`, `inurl:`).
4.  **Fill in Operator Values:** As you enable operators, input fields will magically appear. Type in your desired values.
    * **Pro Tip:** For operators like `filetype:`, `site:`, `inurl:`, `intitle:`, `intext:`, you can use `|` (pipe) to separate multiple values (e.g., `pdf | docx` for `filetype:`). DorkCraft handles the `OR` logic for you!
5.  **Watch the Magic:** Your dork will dynamically appear in the "Generated Dork" box.
6.  **Copy or Search:** Hit "Copy Dork" to grab it, or "Search Dork" to open results directly in a new tab.

## 🚀 What's Next for DorkCraft? (Ideas for Future Awesomeness!)

DorkCraft is just getting started! Here are some ideas to push its capabilities even further:

* **More Advanced Operators:** Support for `AROUND(X)`, date ranges, `after:`, `before:`, `source:`, etc.
* **Dork History:** Save your most powerful dorks for quick reuse (using Local Storage or perhaps a tiny backend if we get fancy).
* **Operator Descriptions:** Small info icons next to each operator to explain its usage.
* **Custom Themes:** Let users personalize the look and feel.
* **Import/Export Dorks:** Share your dork collections with the world.
